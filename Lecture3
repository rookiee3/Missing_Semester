# Complete vimtutor. Note: it looks best in a 80x24 (80 columns by 24 lines) terminal window.
  ~$ vimtutor
  open the vimtutor and follow the instructions
  
# Download our basic vimrc and save it to ~/.vimrc. Read through the well-commented file (using Vim!), and observe how Vim looks and behaves slightly differently with the new config.
  
# Install and configure a plugin: ctrlp.vim.
  Create the plugins directory with mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start
  Download the plugin: cd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start; git clone https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim
  Read the documentation for the plugin. Try using CtrlP to locate a file by navigating to a project directory, opening Vim, and using the Vim command-line to start :CtrlP.
  Customize CtrlP by adding configuration to your ~/.vimrc to open CtrlP by pressing Ctrl-P.

# Use Vim for all your text editing for the next month. Whenever something seems inefficient, or when you think “there must be a better way”, try Googling it, there probably is. If you get stuck, come to office hours or send us an email.

# Configure your other tools to use Vim bindings (see instructions above).

# Further customize your ~/.vimrc and install more plugins.

# (Advanced) Convert XML to JSON (example file) using Vim macros. Try to do this on your own, but you can look at the macros section above if you get stuck.
